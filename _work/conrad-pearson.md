    The Conrad Pearson Clinic needed a new website that was easy to navigate, worked on mobile, and was less clinical feeling. To solve this I designed and built a new site from the ground up.

    The site content was rearchitected to be helpful and easy to find. The tone of the site was shifted to be more friendly and approachable. The imagery was changed to show patients enjoying life post-treatment, and a new more calming color palette was chosen. All of these changes help ease the uncomfortable nature of urological care and hopefully help motivate someone to get the help they need.
